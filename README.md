This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_36/) explores different variations of the exploratory factor analysis method for discovering latent patterns in adequately correlated high-dimensional data. Methods applied in the analysis to estimate and identify potential underlying structures from observed variables included Principal Axes Factor Extraction and Maximum Likelihood Factor Extraction. The approaches used to simplify the derived factor structures to achieve a more interpretable pattern of factor loadings included Varimax Rotation and Promax Rotation. Combinations of the factor extraction and rotation methods were separately applied on the original dataset across different numbers of factors, with the model fit evaluated using the standardized root mean square of the residual, Tucker-Lewis fit index, Bayesian information criterion and high residual rate. The extracted and rotated factors were visualized using the factor loading and dandelion plots.
